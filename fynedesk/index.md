		<p>The FyneDesk project is taking a fresh look
at what it means to be a desktop environment. Using the same beautiful and user
friendly graphics of the Fyne toolkit you will find it a great place to call 
home on your computer.</p>

                <p>We also want to make it easy to update, add to or change
your desktop just like you can with any other Open Source software. And so
the design of our desktop project has put ease of learning and development
in the centre of how we work. Now you can have the desktop of your dreams
- and share the result for others as well.</p>

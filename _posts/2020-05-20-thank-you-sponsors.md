At this difficult time we wanted to take a moment to thank whole heartedly
all the generous sponsors of our Fyne project.

## Releases

Since the [1.2.4 release](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/releases/tag/v1.2.4)
back in April the team have been focusing on shaping up version 1.3.
We are very excited with how this is progressing and look forward to publishing
it early in June. The new features will include

* File Dialogs
* Notifications
* Accordion, Splitter and TextGrid widgets
* Submenu support
* Text truncation and wrapping
* Borderless splash window
* New scaling mode for images
* Smoother rendering on window move/resize

This has been a lot of work to polish and pull together, especially as everyone
has additional worries and stresses to work through.
Our community of developers, testers and contributors have worked tirelessly and
for that we are very grateful. Your support encourages us all to keep working towards
the next milestone!

## Next Big Thing

The upcoming release marks the last of our 1.x releases and we start looking to the
future and what big ideas we can work on next. So far there are working prototypes 
or proposed additions for:

* Data Binding
* Support for running in a web browser
* Animations
* List, Table and Tree widgets
* Drag and Drop

If there is anything that you feel is missing from the list this is a good time to
say. Feel free to add a [feature request](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&milestone=2.0+-+Data+binding%2C+animations%2C+drag+and+drop&template=feature_request.md&title=) 
or join us in the #fyne channel on `gophers` Slack server [invite link](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/).

This release is also the first opportunity we have had since the 1.0 release (over a year ago) to make any breaking changes to the API. Whilst we aim to keep this minimal it does
allow some changes that we have been holding off on. Some deprecated methods may be
removed and it is possible we will move from an int to a floating point coordinate
system (allowing more precision on high resolution devices).

## Share The Love

We want to thank all of our sponsors, supporters and contributors who have helped 
get the Fyne project to where it is today. We have recently taken delivery of our
first sticker prints and will get them in the post shortly. If you would like to 
be one of the first with a `fyne.io` sticker for your laptop (like the picture below)
there is still time to sign up as a sponsor - Kudos level and above get's swag!
